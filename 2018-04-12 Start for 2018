Let's get this restarted!
.
2018. Oh, the projects I'll work on...
There's python code to write (and perhaps Lua?).
ESP8266s to wire and flash (Arduinos too).
DevOps to learn more about.
That HL7 interface guide isn't going to write itself.
I'll update my portfolio Tumblr, code blog, Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub.
Maybe setup and run a virtual server (or two).
Jim's solar power station needs to be built and wired (it'll be summer soon).
I better get going on it all!
